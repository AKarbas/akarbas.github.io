My full name is *Mohammadamin Karbasforushan*, but I go by Amin Karbas.

Advised by [Prof. Ioannis Demertzis](https://www.idemertzis.com), I study
Applied Cryptography and Security, working on Oblivious Computing and Encrypted
Databases and Systems. See below or my [resume](/media/AminKarbas_resume.pdf)
