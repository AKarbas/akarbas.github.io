My full name is Mohammadamin Karbasforushan, but I go by Amin Karbas.

I'm currently a CSE Ph.D. student at U.C. Santa Cruz where I study Applied Cryptography under PI [Ioannis Demertzis](https://www.idemertzis.com).
I'm currently working on oblivious computing and searchable encryption.
Previously, I
did an Internet Measurement research internship at Max Planck Institute for Informatics
and was a data infrastructure engineer at CafeBazaar Cloud (now called Sotoon Cloud).
