My full name is **Mohammadamin Karbasforushan**, but I go by Amin Karbas.

Advised by [Prof. Ioannis Demertzis](https://www.idemertzis.com), I study Applied Cryptography and Security.
I'm currently working on Oblivious Computing and Encrypted Databases and Systems.
See below or my [CV](/media/AminKarbas_cv.pdf) for more.
