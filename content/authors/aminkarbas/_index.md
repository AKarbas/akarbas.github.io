I’m an Iranian Computer Science student with over 2.5 years of industry experience as a Data Infrastructure Engineer. I’m currently doing a research internship at Max Planck Institute for Informatics. I am also a data infrastructure engineer at CafeBazaar Cloud (now called Sotoon): our team provides the platform to transfer, store, and analyze big data at petabyte scale for multiple user-facing apps with 84M+ active users across Android, iOS, and web.

In the past, I have done a Data Engineering summer internship at Sahab Pardaz (after the first year of my bachelor’s); And collaborated with Dr. Shahin Rouhani of Sharif University of Technology as a Machine Learning Engineer.

# Interests:

I am a systems engineer. Generally, my interests are:

* **Operating Systems**: scheduling, security, kernels, firmwares, virtualization, containerization, etc.
* **Architecture**: accelerators, hardware-software co-design, SoCs
* **File Systems** and **Storage**: general-purpose or domain-specific
* **Distributed Computing**: storage systems, cloud computing, scheduling, databases, application-specific accelerators (ex. distributed machine-learning), etc.

In addition, I'm interested in combinations of these, like distributed storage/file-systems or resource disaggregation.
I'm also interested in **Computer Networks** and **Security**.
