My full name is **Mohammadamin Karbasforushan**.

I'm currently a CSE Ph.D. student at U.C. Santa Cruz, where under the advisement of [Prof. Ioannis Demertzis](https://www.idemertzis.com), I study Applied Cryptography.
Previously, I:
* Did a research internship at Max Planck Institute for Informatics, where I worked toward gathering Certificate Transparency Logs' data for further analysis;
* Was a data infrastructure engineer at CafeBazaar Cloud (now called Sotoon): our team provided the platform to transfer, store, and analyze big data at petabyte scale for multiple user-facing apps with 84M+ active users across Android, iOS, and web;
* Did a Data Engineering summer internship at Sahab Pardaz after the first year of my bachelorâ€™s, where we deveolped a practice web search engine; And,
* Collaborated with Dr. Shahin Rouhani of Sharif University of Technology as a Machine Learning Engineer.

I'm originally from Tehran, Iran, where I got my bachelor's degree in CS at Sharif University of Technology.

# Interests:

* **Applied Cryptography**: Searchable Encryption, ORAMs, etc.;
* **Operating Systems**: scheduling, security, kernels, firmwares, virtualization, containerization, etc.;
* **Architecture**: accelerators, hardware-software co-design, SoCs;
* **File Systems** and **Storage**: general-purpose or domain-specific;
* **Distributed Computing**: storage systems, cloud computing, scheduling, databases, application-specific accelerators (ex. distributed machine-learning), etc.

Generally speaking, I'm a systems engineer. I'm also interested in **Computer Networks**, **Security**, and combinations of this long list, like resource disaggregation.
