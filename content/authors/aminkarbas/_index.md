**Currently looking for a PhD position to join in Fall 2021.**

I’m an Iranian Computer Science student with over 2+ years of industry experience as a Data Infrastructure Engineer. I’m currently doing an Internet Measurement research internship at Max Planck Institute for Informatics.

In the past, I have done a Data Engineering summer internship at Sahab Pardaz (after the first year of my bachelor’s); And collaborated with Dr. Shahin Rouhani of Sharif University of Technology as a Machine Learning Engineer.
