I will join UCSC's Computer Science and Engineering department this Fall as a PhD student, advised by [Prof. Ioannis Demertzis](https://www.idemertzis.com).

I’m an Iranian Computer Science student with almost 3 years of industry experience as a Data Infrastructure Engineer.



Previously, I:

* Did a research internship at Max Planck Institute for Informatics, where I worked toward gathering Certificate Transparency Logs' data for further analysis;
* Was a data infrastructure engineer at CafeBazaar Cloud (now called Sotoon): our team provided the platform to transfer, store, and analyze big data at petabyte scale for multiple user-facing apps with 84M+ active users across Android, iOS, and web;
* Did a Data Engineering summer internship at Sahab Pardaz after the first year of my bachelor’s, where we deveolped a practice web search engine; And,
* Collaborated with Dr. Shahin Rouhani of Sharif University of Technology as a Machine Learning Engineer.

# Interests:

I am a systems engineer. Generally, my interests are:

* **Operating Systems**: scheduling, security, kernels, firmwares, virtualization, containerization, etc.;
* **Architecture**: accelerators, hardware-software co-design, SoCs;
* **File Systems** and **Storage**: general-purpose or domain-specific;
* **Distributed Computing**: storage systems, cloud computing, scheduling, databases, application-specific accelerators (ex. distributed machine-learning), etc.

In addition, I'm interested in combinations of these, like resource disaggregation.
I'm also interested in **Computer Networks** and **Security**.
