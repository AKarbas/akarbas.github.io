**Currently looking for a PhD position to join in Fall 2021.**

I'm an Iranian Computer Science student with two years of industry experience as a Data Infrastructure Engineer. I'm currently doing an academic research internship in Internet Measurements.
I'm generally interested in Systems Engineering and related subjects.
